We used Pytorch and BERT language model to implement a movie recommendation system based on the paper [BERT4Sec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06690.pdf). We train the model on the users histories while masking random movies and trying to predict them. Results seems promising but finetuning is necessary to obtain better results.
